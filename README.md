# Draft-Map
So, I struggled to merge these files/codes with the original project files. I did not want to create more confusions for myself and you guys as well by constantly changin
the codes for map and adding it to the main repo. So I have created this repo just for map only because coding this map is a monster in itself.
I will making changes to the codes and once we all can agree upon final version of the map, then I will add all the codes to our main repo for this project.

This map as of right now has 2 markers(pirates symbol) in it , 1 in utah and another in California. They both have total confirmed cases coded in them and it will display
the numbers once you hover over the markers. I think that basically does the job for our project but the limitation to it is the data is not going to be updated
if there is any changes to the data. I am still learning about data visualization as it is a completely different domain than what we have been learning in class.

I can add 50 markers to the 50 states and do the same for all the countries around the world one at a time but I know for sure there is better way to do that
than copying and pasting same code 50 times for the USA and another 200 times for 200 countries. If you guys have any suggestions on how to do that please let me 
know.

Here is the link to the map.
